        "Here's a fun fact: I once spent 6 hours debugging a program, only to realize I had a typo in a variable name! üòÖ That day taught me the importance of careful naming conventions and proper IDEs with syntax highlighting!",
        "I have a weird habit of talking to my code when debugging! üó£Ô∏è Something like 'Okay, what are you trying to do here?' - and surprisingly, it actually helps me think through the logic better. Don't judge! üòÑ",
        "Fun fact: My username 'MithunDu404' has a story! The '404' represents my journey from 'not found' (when I knew nothing about programming) to 'found' (discovering my passion for coding). It's a reminder of how far I've come! üéØ",
        "I can solve a Rubik's cube, and I think it's similar to debugging code - both require pattern recognition, systematic thinking, and patience! üß© Plus, both are satisfying when you finally get them right!"
